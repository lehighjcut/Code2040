# Code2040
Code2040 Application

This contains the challenges provided by Code2040 in the Fellows Program Technical Assessment. Completing this took many hours of research on understanding JSON and HTTP requests, and Python, a language I did not know any of before completing this. Although this was very difficult and hard to fit in my already very busy schedule, it felt very satisfying after finishing all the challenges. It gave me a sense of what to look forward to in my journey to a high level of technical aptitude and I feel like I have improved upon my ability to research using stackoverflow/various documentations so that I can learn quickly.

Thank you Code2040 for presenting me with this challenge!
